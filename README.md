# AvP

## Introduction

AvP performs automatic detection of HGT candidates within a phylogenetic framework. In a nutshell, the pipeline selects proteins based on a similarity hits file (blast or diamond), extracts sequences from the database, performs MSA, and phylogenetic inference. Then, it traverses the tree in order to detect candidate HGTs. Furthermore, it can evaluate the validity of candidate HGTs based on alternative topology testing and surrounding genes on the genome.
